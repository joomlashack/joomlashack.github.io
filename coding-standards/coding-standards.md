# Coding Standards
We always strive for consistency in our code. This can be a challenge
due to the wide range of developers we've acquired our code from and its
history. The standards we adhere to are mainly laid out in the
[php](/coding-standards/php) document.

## JavaScript
  * [Crockford JS Coding Standards](https://www.crockford.com/code.html)
  * [JS DocBlocks](https://devdocs.io/jsdoc/)

Anything not explicitly described in these docs should fallback to the PHP standards.
With the following additional requirements: initial blocks of script should begin with a
semicolon (for compression problems)

## CSS
  * [Google HTML/CSS Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html)
