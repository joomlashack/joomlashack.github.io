We always strive for consistency in our code. This can be a challenge
due to the wide range of developers we've acquired our code from and its
history. The standards we adhere to are mainly laid out in the
[php](php) document.

Our standards for javascript and css are looser but we do intend to adhere
as much as possible to the following generally accepted standards linked below.

* JavaScript
  * [Crockford JS Coding Standards](https://www.crockford.com/code.html)
  * [JS DocBlocks](https://devdocs.io/jsdoc/)

Anything not explicitly described in these docs should fallback to the PHP standards.
With the following additional requirements: initial blocks of script should begin with a
semicolon (for compression problems)

* CSS
  * [Google HTML/CSS Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html)
