# Developer Documentation

Like any development team, we strive to maintain consistency in our code.
To that end we have adopted coding standards that we do our best to follow
with any new code and to make adjustments in any existing code.

If you wish to contribute, please review the [coding standards](/coding-standards)
linked in the menu at the left.

Note that we have acquired much of our code from a wide variety of developers,
you will see quite a lot of severe violations of our standards. We continually
work to correct these issues as much as possible whenever we create patches
for existing code.
